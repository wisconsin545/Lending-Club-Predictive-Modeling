# Lending-Club-Predictive-Modeling
The goal here was to create a loan ingestion pathway from Lending Club's API and use a rules engine to buy peer to peer loans based on our predictive models. 

The big finding here was that from analyzing all their loans over several years from their API we discoverd their default rates were higher than reported and the returns were lower than reported on their website.
